Waple helps you share your Wi-Fi password quickly.ðŸ’­ðŸ§‡

## **Production intention** ðŸ“š

Wi-Fi passwords are usually complicated for security purposes. When trying to use Wi-Fi at a cafe, the password is long and complicated, which is cumbersome. 
You can also type it incorrectly because you see it directly and type it. 

Have you ever looked into a Wi-Fi router to give a password to a guest who invited you home?

Waple is designed to connect Wi-Fi directly with just a few touches, without having to memorize or write down the Wi-Fi password.
It includes a function that allows the store to select the PIN number entry item in consideration of the case where it wants to provide the password only to the buyer.

## **Key Features** ðŸš€

Waple is a service that helps fast and easy Wi-Fi password sharing using sound communication `Euphony`. It provides the following functions:

(Wi-Fi provider) 
- Set shop Wi-Fi name, password setting
- Optional password provision via simple numeric code (PIN) input (âœ”You can choose if you want)

(Wi-Fi user)
- Provide a password with store name information
- Connect directly to Wi-Fi or copy password
- Save the Wi-Fi history you recently received (âœ”Additional functionality)

<br/>

## **How it works** ðŸ¤–

1. Wi-Fi providers register store names, Wi-Fi passwords, PINs, etc. in advance in `Wi-Fi Registration`

2. When the user presses `Find Wi-Fi`, the user checks the list of providers who have registered their passwords in the waffle.

3. If the user selects the Wi-Fi he or she wants, the password of the Wi-Fi is obtained.
